Title: COMP 3104 – DevOps: Course Overview and Key Learnings
Date: 2025-09-26

Introduction:
DevOps is both a culture and a set of practices that bring software development and IT operations together.
The COMP3104 course teaches us how to work collaboratively, automate processes, and use tools that help deliver software faster and more reliably.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, I want to:
- Apply DevOps practices and tools for integration, deployment, and lifecycle management.
- Perform hands-on lab work in Git, GitHub, and automation.
- Collaborate with classmates using branching, commits, and pull requests.
- Use CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions) to test and validate code automatically.
- Understand the importance of monitoring, version control, and automation in real projects.
- Connect DevOps practices to the broader job market and professional roles.

Key Tools and Concepts:
- GitHub → version control and collaboration.
- GitHub Actions → continuous integration workflows.
- Docker → containerization for consistent environments.
- Kubernetes → container orchestration and scaling.
- SonarQube → code quality and security analysis.

How this course prepares me:
- Teaches me how to manage group projects using branches and PRs.
- Helps me learn automation so I can spend less time on manual tasks.
- Builds the habit of frequent, small commits for better collaboration.
- Shows me how CI/CD prevents bugs and reduces risk in software delivery.

Conclusion:
COMP3104 is not only about learning commands or tools, but about adopting a mindset of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.
These skills are directly useful for my future in the IT field, where DevOps practices are a standard.
