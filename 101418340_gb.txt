Title: George Brown College — What it is and why it matters to me
Date: 2025-09-13

Campuses:
- St. James — business & hospitality
- Casa Loma — technology & trades
- Waterfront — health sciences

George Brown College (GBC) is a public college in Toronto with three main
campuses: St. James (business & hospitality), Casa Loma (technology & trades),
and Waterfront (health sciences). Classes combine theory with labs, projects,
and industry partners so students graduate with practical, job-ready skills.

Why GBC works for me:
- Location: being downtown connects me to Toronto’s tech community,
  meetups, internships, and employers
- Applied learning: courses emphasize hands-on work—labs, demos, group
  assignments, and real tooling used in industry.
- Support: tutoring, libraries, career services, and workshops make it easier
  to stay on track and build a portfolio.
- Diversity & teamwork: projects mirror real workplaces where collaboration
  and communication are essential.

Student services to explore:
- Career Centre, library workshops, peer tutoring
- Co-op/internship postings
- Clubs and tech events

In short, GBC gives me an environment to practice real skills with real tools,
while being close to companies I want to work for after graduation.
