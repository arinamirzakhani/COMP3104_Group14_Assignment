Title: COMP3104 – DevOps (Course Summary)
Date: 2025-09-13

Course focus:
- Version control with Git and GitHub: repositories, branching, merges,
  pull requests, and code reviews.
- Team workflow: branch naming conventions, commit hygiene, resolving
  conflicts, and protecting the main branch.
- CI/CD fundamentals: automate build/test using GitHub Actions (or Travis CI),
  write simple YAML workflows, and read pipeline logs.
- Project hygiene: writing a good README, using a PR template, and keeping
  changes small, traceable, and reversible.

Tools & concepts practiced:
- Git, GitHub, Issues/PRs, Actions workflows
- Continuous Integration (run tests on every push/PR)
- Continuous Delivery (keep main deploy-ready)
- Basic scripting/automation and status badges

Course objectives (my checklist):
- Create a public repo that follows the required naming format.
- Work on a personal branch named STUDENTID-Name.
- Make 10+ meaningful commits with clear messages.
- Configure a CI workflow that runs on push/PR and passes.
- Merge to main via PR after review and green checks.
