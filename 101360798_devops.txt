Title: COMP3104 – DevOps (Course Summary)
Date: 2025-10-06

What DevOps Means (student version) :
DevOps = dev + ops working together, with automation, so changes ship faster and safer. The key idea is *small changes + constant feedback*.

## Tools We Used/Discussed
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and Pull Requests
- **GitHub Actions** for CI (runs on every push/PR)
- **Docker** concept for consistent environments (even if basic)

## How CI/CD fits our class
1 Commit to my branch → 2 GitHub Actions runs checks → 3 Open PR → 4 If green, merge to `main`.
[code change] -> [push] -> [CI runs] -> [PR review] -> [merge main]

## Why it helps 
- Catch mistakes early
- Makes history clean
- Teaches real team habits
