# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines development and operations.
It focuses on collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.
## Tools We Learned
In COMP3104, I worked with:
- Git (for version control)
- GitHub (for hosting code and collaborating)
- GitHub Actions (for continuous integration)
- Docker (for containerization)
## CI/CD Workflow
CI/CD means Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
The idea is that every time code is pushed, it is automatically built and tested.
If tests pass, the changes can be deployed quickly.
