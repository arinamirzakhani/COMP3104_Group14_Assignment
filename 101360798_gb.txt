Title: COMP3104 – Student View
Date: 2025-10-06

Why I Chose GBC :
Downtown location + hands-on courses were the main reasons. It’s easy to commute, and most classes focus on labs/projects instead of only exams.

## Campuses & Tools I Use
- **Campuses**: St. James (most of my classes), Casa Loma (tech), Waterfront (great study spaces).
- **D2L Brightspace**: announcements, grades, due dates.
- **MyGB**: registration and official docs.
- **Git & GitHub**: almost every programming subject uses these now.

## Student Services that Helped Me
- Tutoring/Learning Centres for tricky courses
- Library resources (software access + quiet rooms)
- Career Centre for resume/cover-letter advice

### Reflection
The mix of labs and quick feedback fits how I learn. Group projects feel closer to real teamwork.
