Title: COMP3104 – Student View
Date: 2025-10-06

Why I Chose GBC :
Downtown location + hands-on courses were the main reasons. It’s easy to commute even though in the end i chose online, and most classes focus on labs/projects instead of only exams
which could be a major factor in the final decision to chose GBC.

# My Experience at George Brown College

I chose George Brown College because of its strong computer programming program
and the fact that the campus is close to downtown Toronto.


## Campuses & Tools I Use
- **Campuses**: St. James (most of my classes), Casa Loma (tech), Waterfront (great study spaces).
- **D2L Brightspace**: announcements, grades, due dates.
- **MyGB**: registration and official docs.
- **Git & GitHub**: almost every programming subject uses these now.

## Student Services that Helped Me
- Tutoring/Learning Centres for tricky courses
- Library resources (software access + quiet rooms)
- Career Centre for resume/cover-letter advice

### Reflection
The mix of labs and quick feedback fits how I learn. Group projects feel closer to real teamwork.
## Campuses
George Brown has three main campuses: St. James, Casa Loma, and Waterfront.
Most of my programming courses are at Casa Loma, but I have visited the others
for general courses and events.
