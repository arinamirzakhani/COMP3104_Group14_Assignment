Title: Why DevOps is important in the SDLC
Date: 2025-09-13

DevOps integrates development and operations so software moves through the
SDLC faster and with fewer defects. The key is automation plus rapid feedback.

Where it fits in each SDLC phase:
- Planning: shared backlog, clear definitions of done, and measurable goals.
- Development: small, frequent commits on isolated branches; peer review.
- Testing: Continuous Integration runs tests on every push to catch issues
  early (“shift-left” quality).
- Integration/Release: Continuous Delivery packages artifacts consistently,
  reducing “works on my machine” problems.
- Deployment: automated releases with repeatable scripts or workflows.
- Operations/Maintenance: monitoring, logs, alerts, and post-incident learning
  create tight feedback loops for the next iteration.

Benefits to the team:
- Faster lead time from commit to deploy
- Lower change-failure rate and faster recovery (MTTR)
- Reliable, reproducible environments (often via scripts/IaC/containers)
- Transparency: everyone sees build status, test results, and history

Tools & concepts:
- Git, GitHub, Issues, PR templates
- Actions workflows (YAML)
- Status checks and badges

Conclusion: DevOps turns the SDLC into a continuous cycle—plan, build, test,
release, observe, learn—so we deliver value quickly and safely.
