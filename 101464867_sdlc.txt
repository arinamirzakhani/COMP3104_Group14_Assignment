Title: COMP3104 â€“ DevOps' impact on the SDLC
Date: 2025-09-25

DevOps has an enormous impact on the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It integrates development and operations to accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.

The following are ways DevOps accelerates and impacts the SDLC, showing its importance:

    Bridging Development and Operations:

        - Normally, software developers would write the code while a different team dealt with operations and infrastructure. This separation led to roadblocks and bottlenecks due to the interdependency of each team.
        - DevOps integrates both roles so engineers share responsibility, which allows for faster collaboration and fewer miscommunications.

    Faster Delivery & Time-to-Market:

        - DevOps engineers use practices such as Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) to automate, build, test, and release software.
        - This allows them to ship new features, bug fixes, and updates much faster, meeting customer and market needs more quickly.

    Improved Software Quality:

        - Automated testing and monitoring are implemented in every stage of the SDLC, allowing bugs to be caught earlier.
        - Tools such as SonarQube help maintain consistent standards across the code base.
        - Continuous monitoring with tools like Prometheus or Grafana provides feedback loops for quick recovery from issues.

    Reliability & Stability:

        - Automated pipelines minimize the risk of human error.
        - Using practices like Infrastructure as Code (IaC), environments remain reproducible and consistent.

    Scalability & Flexibility:

        - Using the cloud for scalability and including DevOps practices for containerization makes it easy to scale applications dynamically.
        - Teams can adjust resources according to demand, saving costs and improving performance.

    Cultural Shift Toward Collaboration:

        - The DevOps culture encourages ownership, transparency, and continuous learning among developers, testers, security, and operations teams.
        - Increased collaboration also reduces conflict and increases accountability.

    Security Integration (DevSecOps):

        - Security is embedded throughout the SDLC instead of being an afterthought.
        - Automated security scans, compliance checks, and vulnerability testing ensure safer releases.

    Business Value:

        - Faster releases allow for quicker responses to user feedback and changes in the market.
        - Leads to better customer satisfaction and trust due to improved reliability.
        - Efficient workflows reduce costs and increase ROI on software projects.


In summary, DevOps transforms the SDLC by making it faster, more reliable, collaborative, and customer-focused. It shifts software development from a slow, siloed process into a continuous cycle of integration, delivery, monitoring, and improvement.
