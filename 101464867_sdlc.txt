Title: COMP3104 â€“ DevOps' impact on the SDLC
Date: 2025-09-25

DevOps has an enormous impact on the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), it integrates devlopment and operations to accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.

The following are ways how DevOps accelerates and impact SDLC and shows the importance of DevOps to the SDLC:

    - Bridging Development and Operations:
        
        - Normally software developers would write the code while a different team dealt with operations and infrastructure, this separation lead to roadblocks and bottlenecks, due to the interdepenedency of each to the other.
        
        - DevOps intergrates both roles so DevOps engineers share the responsibility, which allows for faster collaboration and fewer miscommunication.

    - Faster Delivery & Time-to-Market:

        - DevOps engineers user practices such as Continous Intergration (CI) and Continous Deployment (CD) to automate, build test and release software.

        - This allows them to ship new features, bug fixes and updates much faster. As well as meeting the customer and market needs much more quickly.

    - Improved Software Quality:
        
        - Automated testing and montioring is implemented in every stage of the SDLC which allows us to catch bugs earlier.

        - Using tools such as SonarQube also allows use to maintain consisten standards across the code base.

        - Continous monitoring with tools like Prometheus or Grafana provide us feedback loops for quick recovery from issues.


    - Reliability & Stability:
        
        - With automated pipelines we minimize the risk of human errors

        - Using practices like Infrasturcture as Code (IaC) we ensure that envirmoents are reproducible and consistent

    - Scalability & Flexibility:

        - Using the cloud for scalability and including DevOps practices for contarization it makes it easy to scale application dynamically.

        - Teams can adjust recouse according to demand which saves on cost and helps with performance 


In summary, DevOps transforms the SDLC by making it faster, more reliable, collaborative, and customer-focused. It shifts software development from a slow, siloed process into a continuous cycle of integration, delivery, monitoring, and improvement.
