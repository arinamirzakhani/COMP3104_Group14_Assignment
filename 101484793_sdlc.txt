DevOps plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It bridges the gap between development and operations by promoting communication, collaboration, and automation. 
Through CI/CD, code is tested, integrated, and deployed faster, reducing errors and improving reliability. 
DevOps also ensures continuous monitoring and feedback, which helps teams deliver value to customers more quickly. 
Incorporating DevOps into the SDLC enhances software quality, shortens release cycles, and supports agile methodologies.
