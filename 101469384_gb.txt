Title: George Brown College — What it is and why it matters to me
Date: 2025-09-26

Introduction:
George Brown College (GBC) is a public college in Toronto with three main campuses:
- St. James (business & hospitality) - strong industry talks for business/tech cross-over.
- Casa Loma (technology & trades) - labs for programming, networking, and hardware.
- Waterfront (health sciences) - modern spaces and inter-disciplinary projects.
Each campus specializes in certain areas, but all share the same goal: combining theory with hands-on practice and strong connections to industry.

Why George Brown is important to me:
- Location: Being in the heart of Toronto means access to the tech community, networking events, and employers. It also makes it easier to find internships and co-ops.
- Applied Learning: Courses include labs, projects, and group assignments that mirror real workplace scenarios. This helps me gain job-ready skills before graduation.
- Support Systems: Tutoring, libraries, career services, and workshops are available to help students manage challenges and stay on track.
- Diversity & Collaboration: Working in diverse teams allows me to practice communication and teamwork, skills that are crucial in the IT industry.
- Real-World Connections: GBC partners with local employers and organizations, so students are better prepared for the job market.

Student Services I plan to use:
- Career Centre: resume building, interview prep, and co-op opportunities.
- Tutoring & Learning Centres: academic support for programming and technical courses.
- Student Clubs & Hackathons: opportunities to apply what I learn in class and build my portfolio.

Conclusion:
For me, GBC is not just about classes — it’s about preparing for the real world.
My goals include improving my programming and DevOps skills, building a portfolio of projects on GitHub, and connecting with industry professionals to start my career with confidence.
