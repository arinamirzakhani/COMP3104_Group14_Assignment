Title: COMP3104 – DevOps in the SDLC — Why It Matters
Date: 2025-10-06

SDLC in one line :
Plan → Design → Implement → Test → Deploy → Maintain.

The point: reduce risk by moving in steps and checking quality at each stage.

## Where DevOps plugs into each stage
- **Plan/Design**: small tickets; acceptance criteria clear
- **Implement**: feature branches; frequent commits; code reviews
- **Test**: CI runs tests/lints on every push/PR
- **Deploy**: CD can auto-promote a green build
- **Maintain**: logs/metrics show issues so we fix quickly

## My Example from this Project
Branch: `101360798-MelicaAlikhaniMarqueti`. I committed in small steps, opened a PR, and waited for CI to go green before merging.

### Wrap-up
Learning DevOps in the SDLC trained me to ship small, tested changes. That rhythm is what real teams expect.
