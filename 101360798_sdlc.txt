# The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a structured process for building software. It usually includes
requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
## Where DevOps Fits
DevOps practices support each stage of the SDLC:
- Requirements: use collaboration tools like GitHub Issues
- Design: communicate clearly with team members
- Implementation: code on feature branches and commit regularly
- Testing: use GitHub Actions to run tests
- Deployment: use CI/CD pipelines
- Maintenance: monitor logs and update software continuously
