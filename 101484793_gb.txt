George Brown is known for integrating technology into its teaching. 
In technology programs, students gain hands-on experience not only with programming and version control systems but also with modern DevOps tools. 
For example, labs may introduce virtualization platforms such as **Vagrant** to simulate production-like environments for students, and **Terraform** to showcase Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in cloud computing contexts.

Partnerships with companies across Torontoâ€™s tech sector help ensure that students learn tools and workflows that are relevant to the job market. 
This focus on applied skills gives graduates a competitive edge, particularly in fields like software development, IT operations, and DevOps engineering.

In summary, George Brown College blends academic instruction with industry-relevant, hands-on training, making it an ideal environment for students to prepare for careers in modern, technology-driven fields.
