Title: COMP3104 – DevOps (Course Summary)
Date: 2025-09-26

COMP3104 – DevOps introduces students to the modern practices and workflows that bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. 
The course emphasizes version control with Git and GitHub, collaborative workflows through branching, and automation with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). 
It also highlights the importance of reproducible environments and infrastructure automation in today’s industry.

Learning Outcomes:
By completing this course, students will be able to:
- Work with Git/GitHub for source control, branching, and collaborative project management.
- Automate testing and deployments using CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Travis CI).
- Build reproducible development environments using **Vagrant** to ensure consistency across teams.
- Manage infrastructure using **Terraform**, defining systems as code that can be versioned and deployed reliably.
- Understand the differences between monolithic and microservices-based architectures, and apply DevOps practices accordingly.
- Monitor software quality and performance with automated checks and feedback loops.
- Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to scale projects in cloud environments.

Key Tools and Resources:
- GitHub – for source control, branching strategies, and collaboration.
- Vagrant – to provision lightweight, repeatable development environments.
- Terraform – to manage and automate infrastructure deployments across providers.
- Docker – for containerization, ensuring consistent environments from dev to production.
- Kubernetes – for orchestration and scaling of containerized applications.
- SonarQube – to analyze code quality and detect vulnerabilities.

Course Expectations:
- Actively contribute to team projects and GitHub repositories, following the branch-per-developer strategy.
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages, demonstrating incremental progress.
- Complete lab activities that focus on automation, environment setup, and pipeline configuration.
- Stay engaged with quizzes and assignments that reinforce both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
